Refer the following to know which file does what

1) DubinsCar u predictor - tries different ML models and a neural network on the whole single car data

2) Dubins optimal path - numerical optimization code for single car

3) SeparateClassifierSimulator - This file trains RFC for single car for near and far cases separately, and was used to plot simulations

4) Decision Tree visualization - plots the tree structure for the simplest case

5) Decision Tree whole - trains a single decision tree for single car both near and far cases, but SeparateClassifierSimulator was used

6) DubinsAditya - this file does numerical optimization, and was used for generating training data for single car case

7) TwoCarTraining - Trains Pursuer and Evader models, prints optimal paths

Note - all preprocessing done in respective files, just need to run them with data path changed. Just use the data folder, it has all required data
